        Yuji Itadori is an expert at track and field. But he has zero interest running around in circles,
        he's happy as a clam in the Occult Research Club. Although he's only in the club for kicks,
        things get serious when a real spirit shows up at school!
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        When his grandfather is on his deathbed, Yuji makes a promise to him; that he will do kind deeds
        so that he dies surrounded by loved ones, unlike his grandfather.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        However, Yuji's life takes a sudden turn as he meets Megumi Fushiguro; a jujutsu sorcerer who tries
        to retrieve a cursed object. When Yuji's friends open the cursed object that they found, things go
        south as the cursed spirits that it spawned start roaming in school. As Fushiguro and Yuji are almost
        defeated by one of the spirits, Yuji then swallows the cursed object and gains its power. As a result,
        Yuji becomes cursed by the object and gets dragged into Fushiguro's thrilling world of jujutsu sorcerers
        and cursed spirits.
